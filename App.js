// Frontend for a shift management app, created by Chris for a school project at Pellissippi.
// Designed to improve shift scheduling and management.
// Allows users to log in, create accounts, browse shifts, and view work history.
// This frontend is ready to connect to a backend system, which is yet to be developed.
// Client: Simona Zlatanova. All rights to the code belong to the client.
// Most of what you see is random mock ups to show the end product of what the app will look like.
