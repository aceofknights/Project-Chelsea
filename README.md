# Pellissippi-Project
This application represents the frontend of a project created by Chris for a school project at Pellissippi. It is designed to revolutionize the way people manage shifts and work schedules. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily log in, create accounts, browse available shifts, and view their work history.

Note: This frontend is designed to be seamlessly integrated with a backend system, which is yet to be developed. The backend will handle user authentication, data storage, and other essential functionalities to make the application fully functional.

The steps below are details to how to download this code and run it locally on your machine. 


Step 1 download and install vscode 

step 2 install node.js from their website
make sure to add node.js to enviromental variables if its not already you computer may need a restart after adding mine did

Step 3 download and install github desktop
This step can be skipped but for simplicity I will be using and explaing through this

Step 4 open the project in github desktop
Click on the green code button and use open with github desktop, go through the promts to open and clone the repo.

step 5 open the project with vs code
using github desktop theres a button to do this.

step 6 start the metro bundler
run the command npm -start in a new terminal to begin the metro bundler this will start a local server hosting the application you will see a bunch of code fly by in the terminal and a qr code will be genereated

From here you have 3 different option to see the application running: opening the app in a local window, running a emulated mobile device, or running it on your own device

The easiest option is the windows:
  for this all you need to do is hit the 'W' key in the terminal to open a new window for the app. Note that some function may not work in a web browser as this is meant to be a mobile applicaiton

The next option is you can download andriod studio and run a emulated device
  For this option you need to have the device open and hitting the 'A' key will open the application on the mobile device.

The last option is to run this off your own device:
  For this option you will need to download Expo from the app store, Next you will need to be on the same network as the machine running the metro bundler. Scan the QR code with you device camera and it will open the project on your device.

This applicaiton has been tested on a emulated google pixle 3, and a samsung galaxy 9 with success.

Expo can be buggy at time so if it gets stuck on a loading screen completely close out of the app and restart the bundler by hitting control c in the terminal. This usally fixes any issues and make sure you are on the same network!!!!
