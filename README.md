# Pellissippi-Project
This application represents the frontend of a project created by Chris for a school project at Pellissippi. It is designed to revolutionize the way people manage shifts and work schedules. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily log in, create accounts, browse available shifts, and view their work history.

Note: This frontend is designed to be seamlessly integrated with a backend system, which is yet to be developed. The backend will handle user authentication, data storage, and other essential functionalities to make the application fully functional.
